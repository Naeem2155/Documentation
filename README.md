# Documentation
The process_image function is documented with a docstring, which describes the purpose of the function, its input parameters, and the return value.

Comments within the function explain each step of the image processing pipeline.

Comments in the if __name__ == "__main__": block explain the purpose of the code within this block.

You can adapt this template to your specific use case and add more details to your documentation as needed. It's important to document not only the function and class definitions but also complex operations and logic within your code to make it more understandable for yourself and others who may work with your code in the future.
